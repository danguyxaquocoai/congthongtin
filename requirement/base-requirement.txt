# Project Requirements: Member Info Display (HTML/CSS/JS)

## Overview

This project is a **static website** built with **HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)** and **vanilla JavaScript**, optimized primarily for **mobile display**. It will automatically deploy to **GitHub Pages**.

The purpose of this project is to display information about team members based on provided data files.

---

## Data Structure

* Member data is stored under the path: `/data/members/{{member_id}}`
* Each member folder contains:

  * **Avatar image** (e.g., `avatar.jpg`)
  * **JSON file** with member details. Example structure:

```json
{
  "title": "ĐẢNG BỘ THÀNH PHỐ HÀ NỘI\nĐẢNG ỦY XÃ QUỐC OAI",
  "card_number": "01.09895.035187003459.XA",
  "full_name": "Nguyễn Thị Thu Thuỷ",
  "birth_date": "18/10/1987",
  "gender": "Nữ",
  "citizen_id": "035187003459",
  "organization": "Đảng uỷ xã Quốc Oai, TP Hà Nội",
  "department": "Văn phòng Đảng uỷ xã Quốc Oai",
  "position": "Chuyên viên"
}
```

---

## Functionality

* When a user visits: `{{domain}}/members/{{member_id}}`
* The page should:

  1. Fetch the JSON file for that `member_id` via **AJAX**.
  2. Display the member's information on the page.

---

## UI/UX Requirements

* Member info should be displayed inside a **card-style layout**:

  * **Logo**: Located at the **top-right** (`/data/card/logo.jpg`).
  * **Title**: Positioned at the **top-left**.
  * Other fields: Shown as `Label` (above) and `Value` (below).
  * Card styling:

    * Light box shadow
    * Margins: \~5px on left, top, and right
    * Rounded corners
    * Background image: `/data/card/bg.jpg` with a **white fallback** color.

---

## Deployment

* The site must be configured for **automatic deployment to GitHub Pages**.

---

## Notes

* The site should be lightweight and responsive, prioritizing mobile users.
* Use Bootstrap only for layout and styling utilities; avoid heavy components to keep it fast.
